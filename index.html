      <img src="img/chapter1.png" alt="How We Met">
      <h4 style="text-align: left;">Who knew that a simple story reply would lead us here? The day our worlds collided is a day I will never forget.</h4>
      <p style="text-align: left;">I never could have imagined in my life that I’d be so lucky to have you become such an important part of it. Looking back, it all feels like a dream. From waiting months for your reply to hearing you call me 'meri jaan,' it’s the greatest thing that’s ever happened to me. You bring me so much happiness, my love. You are like an oasis in my desert , the spark that lights my soul, you are the key to my joy , you are the light that brighten my dasrkest day and I am really thankful to Allah , to this life that you exist at the same time that I do and our paths crossed. </p>

      <p>I still remember the butterflies from our first date. A day to remember forever.</p>

      <h2>Our First Journey</h2>
      <img src="img/drive1.png" alt="First Trip">
      <h4 style="text-align: left;">Exploring new places and creating memories to last a lifetime. With you, every place feels like home.</h4>
      <p style="text-align: left;">I miss the time when we used to go out in the car , when we were together and there was no distance between us. The first time we held hands, it felt like I was holding my entire world in my hands. In that moment, I became the happiest person on Earth, as if I was cradling the stars themselves. That day, August 22, 2024, will forever be the day my heart found its home. I found you, and in you, I found my home. The way you used to hold my arms made me feel so special, like I was where I truly belonged. I never wanted to let you go. Just like we used to drive together, unhurried and full of ease, surrounded by love, we’ll journey through life the same way—side by side, forever, my love. I love you.</p>

      <h2>Laughter and Love</h2>
      <img src="img/boy-girl-pasta2.png" alt="Silly Moments">
      <h4 style="text-align: left;">The best part of us is how much we laugh together. You make every moment brighter.</h4>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Do you remember how we used to talk about feeding each other? That picture reminds me of when we made it a reality and fed each other for the first time (and of course, how we also stole a taste from each other’s lips, haha). I will always want to eat from your hands, to feed you, to taste your lips—and to taste the love in you. I’m waiting for the day when we’ll feed each other again, because that kind of sweetness is something I can only find with you.</p>

      <h2>The Magic in the Everyday</h2>
      <img src="img/boy-girl-talking.png" alt="Little Moments">
      <h4 style="text-align: left;">Its the little things that makes me fall for you</h4>
      <p style="text-align: left;">You are a beautiful reminder of how blessed I am to have you in my life. It’s the little things that make me fall for you—your smile, the way you look at me, the simple gestures that speak volumes. Each moment we share, no matter how small, is filled with joy, laughter, and the warmth of your presence. With every step we take together, our bond grows stronger, and I feel even more grateful to call you mine. I can’t wait to continue this beautiful journey with you.</p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">I am looking forward to living a life with you and, one day, dying in your arms. I want to be with you until my very last breath, and then meet you in Jannah, InshaAllah, where our love will continue for eternity. I see our future filled with endless moments of joy, growth, and companionship, where we support each other through every challenge and celebrate every victory.
